Welcome to the RoboJackets IGVC software repo!
This document will give you a brief description of the repo's layout and some simple instructions for building the documentation and project. For more detailed information, please visit wiki.robojackets.org

## Folder Structure
The repo is comprised of two ROS packages and one sandbox folder for miscelaneous resources.
FOLDERS
 * igvc
    This is the primary ROS package that houses all of our source code.
 * igvc_msgs
    This package defines custom message types for our code.
 * sandbox
    This folder contains miscelaneous resources. This includes source code for our robot's Arduinos and Ardupilot IMU, udev rules for our robot's hardware, and other files.


## Building Documentation
Documentation for our code can be generated via the rosdoc_lite tool.


## Building Code
This repository should be cloned into the src directory of a catkin workspace. Use `catkin_make` in the workspace directory to build the code. Dependencies can be installed with `rosdep install igvc`. (NOTE: Be sure to `source devel/setup.sh` before referencing the igvc or igvc_msgs packages.)
